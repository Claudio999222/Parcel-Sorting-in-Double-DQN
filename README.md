# Double Deep Q-Learning for Package Sorting

## Overview

This notebook demonstrates the application of Double Deep Q-Learning (Double DQN) to solve the package sorting problem. The task involves efficiently moving packages from one warehouse to another. Double DQN is an extension of Deep Q-Learning that addresses the overestimation bias in Q-values.

## Key Steps:

1. **Environment Setup**: Creating an instance of the package sorting environment, defining states, actions, and rewards.

2. **Double DQN Agent**: Implementing the Double DQN agent architecture, including the primary and target Q-networks.

3. **Experience Replay**: Utilizing experience replay to store and sample past experiences for more stable training.

4. **Training Loop**: Implementing the training loop for the Double DQN algorithm.

5. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the trained agent's performance on various episodes.

## Application:

- **Warehouse Automation**: This approach can be applied to optimize the sorting process in warehouses, where packages need to be efficiently moved to their respective destinations.

- **Handling Dynamic Environments**: Double DQN is designed to handle scenarios where the environment is dynamic, and Q-value overestimation can be an issue.

## Results:

- The notebook will display results such as total rewards, episode lengths, and the agent's performance in sorting packages.

- Experiment with hyperparameters, neural network architectures, and training settings to fine-tune the performance.

## Note:

- Ensure that the required dependencies, including a suitable deep learning framework, are installed before running the notebook.

- Adjust the environment, state representation, and action space according to the specifics of the package sorting problem.
