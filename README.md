# Parcel Sorting in Double DQN
 # Parcel Sorting with Double DQN  ## Overview  This notebook demonstrates the application of Double Deep Q-Learning (Double DQN) to solve the Parcel Sorting problem. The Parcel Sorting task involves training an agent to efficiently sort parcels based on their destinations, considering various factors such as parcel sizes and conveyor belt constraints.  ## Key Steps:  1. **Environment Setup**: Creating an environment that simulates the Parcel Sorting task, including conveyor belts, parcels, and sorting mechanisms.  2. **Double DQN Agent Architecture**: Defining the architecture for the Double DQN agent, which includes both online and target networks.  3. **Experience Replay Buffer**: Implementing an experience replay buffer to store and sample experiences for more stable training.  4. **Training Loop**: Designing the training loop for the Double DQN algorithm to iteratively improve the agent's sorting strategy.  5. **Visualization**: Visualizing the sorting process, agent's actions, and performance metrics during and after training.  ## Application:  - **Automated Parcel Sorting Systems**: Double DQN can be applied to real-world scenarios where automated systems need to efficiently sort parcels based on various criteria.  - **Optimization of Sorting Processes**: The agent learns to optimize sorting strategies, considering the dynamic nature of incoming parcels and conveyor belt configurations.  - **Adaptive Decision-Making**: Double DQN allows the agent to make adaptive decisions by learning from its experiences and adjusting its sorting policy accordingly.  ## Results:  - The trained Double DQN agent should showcase improved parcel sorting efficiency and adaptability to changing conditions.  - Metrics such as sorting accuracy, throughput, and overall system efficiency can be analyzed to evaluate the agent's performance.  ## Note:  - Ensure that the required dependencies, including Gymnasium, TensorFlow, and other related libraries, are installed before running the notebook.  - Adjust hyperparameters, neural network architecture, and training settings based on the specifics of the Parcel Sorting environment and requirements.
